# Data structures
> Option 3


I implemented a standard unbalanced binary tree. It performs insertions in O(log n) time as shown by this graph:
![insertion](../insertion.copy3.png)
(Insertion time is in nanoseconds, x axis is the number of elements in the tree)

It also performs find min in O(log n) time as shown by this graph:
![findmin](../findMinbinary.png)
This graph is also logarithmic, but the highly randomized nature of the tests makes it more chaotic.


I also implemented an AVL tree, which also performs insert and find-min in O(log n) time. 
![insertion](../insertionAVL.png)
(insertion)
![findmin](../findMinAVL.png)
(find min)
